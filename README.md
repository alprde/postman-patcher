# Postman patcher

> Postman does not allow you to render javascript in your response previews, And thats for a good reason. they limit the scripts for security 

But what if you need to run your `react`, `vue` or any other javascript scripts. Saddly postman does not give you an option to allow or disallow javascript manually, So thats why this project exists
## Requirements

* Postman
* Python3
